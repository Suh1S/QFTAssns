Rules of the Bad Plot(s)/Chara Profile(s) quiz

3. There will be 10 bad plot questions, in varying order of difficulty

4. The Chara Profile round only requires the name of the anime character, not the anime (writing the anime won't give you any points)

7. There will be 10 chara profile questions
8. The quiz will be held using Google Forms, and will be timed (a maximum of 25 minutes will be given for filling out the answers)
